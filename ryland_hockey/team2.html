    <h3>6U</h3>
    
   <p1> Rylands first year in 6u was intimidating to start.  It was the first time we watched our child being evaluated.  At the time we were unaware just how unimportant the evaluation was for his age.  All the teams would be made equally across the board. We ended up with a terrific team with great coaches.  It definetely ended up being a great year and one to remember. We quickly learned that once you're on a team with these kids and spend so much time with their families you build great friendships.</p>
