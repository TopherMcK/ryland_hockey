    <h5><strong>HCOFSTL</strong></h5>
    <p>During Rylands 2nd year of 6u his coach talked to us about getting him to try out for Hockey Club of St. Louis.  We were aloud to attend a few practices to check it out.  He loved it and was determined to make the team. During the tryouts there were 96 kids participating and wouldn't you know it my hard working son made it.  It was a very proud moment for us.  During the fall tryouts for HCOFSTL I couldn't believe just how good all the kids had gotten.  Ryland worked his butt off to secure a spot, but my favorite line from him was "Even if I don't make it I'll still have a great year on the Sharks right dad?" Proud dad moment.  Nothing wrong with being competitive but he understands this is about fun first.</p>
